Dev C++ is an IDE for the C and C++ programming languages. It was originally released in 1998 and has had several forks since. This IDE is recommended by the professors on campus.\nBenefits of Dev-C++ \u0026hellip;\nWhy is it bad? It is VERY outdated. This IDE is lacking:\nVersion control integration Syntax highlighting Meaningful extensions Comprenhensive code completion Features and refinements from newer GCC compilers Dev-C++ is LITERALLY broken! There is an \u0026ldquo;undo\u0026rdquo; bug. When you hit the undo/redo buttons multiple times, your code can become corrupted. Large sections of your source code will be deleted! Additionally, the IDE will sometimes just crash at random.\nStop using Dev-C++ It is not safe to rely on Dev-C++ when completing programming assignments. Luckily, there are plenty of alternatives that can be used instead.\nAlternative: VS Code VS Code is not an IDE, but it is way more functional than Dev-C++ and works for school assignments. It may seem daunting at first, but it is really not bad to set up. It is very extensible, and can be used for numerous programming languages. For those that do not wish to support Microsoft, there is an alternative called VSCodium.\nInstalling a C/C++ compiler A C/C++ compiler will need to be manually acquired to use with VS Code. One such option is through MSYS2. Once downloaded, run pacman â€“Syu to update the base packages. Then, run pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-toolchain to install GCC and other utilities. Finally, add the MSYS2 bin directory to the path. More details can be found here.\nUsing a Makefile The easiest way to compile C/C++ programs is with a Makefile. To install make using MSYS2, run pacman --S make. You can use a premade Makefile, or follow this tutorial to create a Makefile.\nNeed an IDE? Visual Studio Jetbrains CLion This IDE is paid, but it can be accessed for free with the GitHub student pack. Code::Blocks This has a lot of the same problems as Dev-C++, but it does not delete your code! Next Week Next week, we will be having a meeting on Thursday at 11 AM in Eberly 342. Have a resume ready for February 29th, in which there will be a resume workshop.\n","permalink":"https://pwsdc.github.io/posts/2024-02-15-fifth-spring-meeting/","summary":"club meeting, downsides of using dev c++, dev c++ alternatives","title":"5th Spring Meeting"},{"content":" Overview Attendance Resume/Internships Presentation Attendance Abu Shettima Christian Messmer Jeremiah Neff Lavender Wilson Matthew Williams Paul Shriner Zach Teixido Resume/Internships Presentation We plan to have someone from the Career Center have a presentation and a resume workshop on the 29th this month. Plan to have a resume available to review for a workshop (a good source is resumake)\nNowadays, resumes are a little different than they used to be. Companies are now getting resumes from all over the world for any roles they post. Because there are just way too many resumes to go through by hand, they use bots to really quickly narrow down the amount of resumes to something manageable by hand.\nThe first pass generally includes keywords that the job description contains, which are relevant to the role. DO NOT include anything about ethnicity, race, religion, etc. on your resume; companies do not want to be worried about discrimination problems that may arise.\nWhen creating your resume, reword the job post description; you want your resume to align as closely as possible to the specific position. This takes longer, but will increase your chances of getting a resume through.\nFor us (students), put some experience even if it is not necessarily related to the job; it\u0026rsquo;s important that the companies know that you do have some experience within a workplace environment.\nAgain for us, our projects section of our resumes will likely be the largest portion of our resumes. Relevant work experience is nice, yes, but projects show off what you are actually capable of. List all of your languages in your skills section; this is an extremely technical field, so the skills section should be large. Your projects should back up each of the skills you list.\nBe ready to talk about anything on your resume, but also don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to say \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know\u0026rdquo;; it\u0026rsquo;s better than trying to lie your way through something you don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor most jobs apart from FAANG* companies (and especially for entry-level roles), the technical interview really is only there to ensure that you know the basics well.\nAfter sending in a resume for a role, wait about 2-3 weeks for a response. If there hasn\u0026rsquo;t been one, reach out and ask about it / continue to show interest in the role. This can help boost your chances of being selected for an interview.\n*FAANG is an acronym for Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google.\n","permalink":"https://pwsdc.github.io/posts/2024-02-08-fourth-spring-meeting/","summary":"club meeting, resume/job search","title":"4th Spring Meeting"},{"content":" Overview Attendance Malware Presentation What is Malware? Types of Malware Viruses Worms Ransomware History of Antivirus How is Malware Made? How to Protect Yourself Next Week Attendance Abu Shettima Christian Beatty Christian Messmer Jeremiah Neff Jonathan Buckel Lavender Wilson Matthew Williams Paul Shriner Seth Morgan Zach Teixido Zullikha Hassan Malware What is Malware? Malware stands for \u0026ldquo;malicious software,\u0026rdquo; and refers to any software that is harmful or intrusive. Malware:\nHas been around since the beginning of computing Early malware had a style reminiscent of the demoscene Has evolved with computing (started with copying via disks, now often travel through the internet) Types of Malware Virus: Code that copies itself into other files and programs, allowing it to spread. Worm: Similar to a virus, but can spread without the need of a human to enable it. Ransomware: Software that encrypts your data and demands payment as a ransom. Adware: Displays unwanted advertisements. Spyware: Gathers information about the user unknowingly. Rootkit: Hides the existence of malware in a system. People tend to assume that malware will always destroy your computer; while they can, generally they pursue more nefarious means (such as stealing data or holding a system for ransom).\nViruses Creeper First ever computer virus Created as a proof of concept Elk Cloner, Brain First viruses to get out into the wild Viruses can be as creative as they are destructive. Viruses are not as popular now, mainly because security has gotten much better.\nWorms ILOVEYOU (2000) You would get an email with the subject \u0026ldquo;ILOVEYOU,\u0026rdquo; and an attachment with a supposed love letter Code Red (2001) Specifically targeted systems running IIS for Windows Server Blaster (2003) Exploited a known vulnerability in Windows 2000 and XP Millions were affected, including government services Buffer overflow would cause the system to reboot every so often Worms such as Sasser and Blaster showed how unsecure Windows was then Ransomware WannaCry (2017) Used an exploit called EternalBlue to get into Windows computers Encrypts files and demands Bitcoin payment Brief History of Antivirus Reaper First antivirus Designed to remove Creeper McAfee VirusScan First widespread antivirus Created in 1987 by John McAfee Several antivirus solutions have since came out from ESET, Avast, Kaspersky, Norton, and more Some antivirus solutions are worse than the malware they prevent How is Malware Made?

Using Git Using GitHub Actually Using GitHub Group work Gitignore Next Week Attendance Abu Shettima Christian Messmer Jonathan Buckel Lavender Wilson Matthew Williams Paul Shriner Seth Morgan Zach Teixido GitHub Presentation Git/GitHub At its core, Git is version control software. To install:\nGo to the download link and follow the instructions Git works by tracking changes that are made to any source files. It then logs the changes, and keeps them stored. It essetially gives you a code history, allowing you to revert your codebase to previous versions. Proper version control makes it much easier to debug.\nGitHub is an online platform that integrates with Git in order to keep files and file histories online, allowing a higher degree of collaboration. To use it, you must create an account. Putting projects and other code on your GitHub can be a useful tool for getting a job.\nUsing Git (via Terminal) To create a git repository, you can run git init in any directory. A directory named .git (hidden by default) will be created; do not touch this folder. It is the root of your repository.\nYou can add, remove, or change any files in the root folder. Once you\u0026rsquo;re satisfied with your changes, you must add them to be tracked via the command git add [your files], or, if you want to add everything, git add ..\nAfter adding any untracked files, you can commit them to a branch via git commit.\nUsing GitHub Most of the time, you\u0026rsquo;ll be essentially copying an existing repository from online. To do this, you can fork (essentially make an online copy of a repo that you own) a repo and then clone (make a local copy) of your forked repo. For cloning, you can also do it with git in the command line via git clone [link-to-your-fork].\nAfter doing anything on your local repo (via git add, git commit, git restore, etc.), you can push your changes (only committed work) onto the remote repo (the online copy) via git push.\nIf your local repo is behind your remote one, you can sync your local one up to date with git pull.\nActually Using GitHub Chances are very high that you will rarely actually use the command line to do all your version control; the vast majority of IDEs have integrated git capabilites, and you\u0026rsquo;ll use it through those (it\u0026rsquo;s much easier). All the concepts are still the same (with adding, committing, pushing, pulling, etc.), but most of them will use a more visual representation (and they look nicer).\nGroup work: Forks, Pull Requests, and Merge Conflicts A fork is a personal copy of any repository. The fork is where all your local changes will be saved when you push changes from your local repo. It is very bad practice to upload your changes straight to the master branch; always push to your fork first, and then merge them later, once you\u0026rsquo;ve confirmed everything is as intended.\nA pull request is a request by you to merge the changes in your fork into the main repository. In this process, your code will be peer-reviewed, and it will be either accepted or denied. After a pull request is accepted, it is final, and everything will then update to include the changes in the pull request.\nUsually, GitHub is really smart with how it handles merging. Unless you have two different files with the same file, everything will put itself together automatically. Sometimes, you\u0026rsquo;ll encounter a merge conflict, which you will have to solve manually. The easiest way to avoid them is to work on different files than everyone else.\nGitignore Inside the root of your project, you can create a file called .gitignore. Inside this file, you can specify anything you want git to ignore when tracking items. This is a very useful tool for excluding unnecessary files or folders.\n# An example of a .gitignore file. # \u0026lt;- (comments are made using an octothorp.)\r# A directory to ignore.\r.\\folder-name\\\r# A specific file to ignore.\rFILENAME.txt\r# A specific file type to ignore. *.txt Generally, dependencies take up a lot of space. These should be specified in your .gitignore files (which is generally handled by your package manager).\nNext Week Next Thursday is the Club \u0026amp; Org fair; We will still have a meeting, but Christian and Lavender will be at the club fair to promote the club. The meeting will be a more relaxed meeting with LeetCode problems.\n","permalink":"https://pwsdc.github.io/posts/2024-01-18-first-spring-meeting/","summary":"club meeting, Git, GitHub","title":"1st Spring Meeting"},{"content":" Overview Attendance LeetCode Problems Next Week Attendance Christian Messmer Abu Shettima John Gerega (for about 5 minutes) Lavender Wilson Matthew Williams Paul Shriner LeetCode Problems We went over several LeetCode problems.

As usual, meetings will be on Thursdays from 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM in Eberly 342.\nFirst Week Meeting In our first meeting, we will do a semi-quick primer/refresher on GitHub (what it is, how to use it, etc).\nClub Fair Historically they have been on Thursdays, so we will have to decide whether we will have a club meeting that day. The current plan is to focus on hosting our table at the fair to garner more attention and skipping that meeting.\nCommuters Discussed how friendly/unfriendly the club is for commuters. We found no huge issues (being in the middle of the day) but there were only 2 people in this meeting who were commuters that could give input.\nCoding Competition Discussed whether or not we should attend a coding competition brought up by a professor. Competitions are generally composed of creating algorithms, code/game jams (open ended prompts), or writing very obscure code (among other styles that were not brought up in this meeting).\nClub Project Attempts The club projects always seem to die; if we want to do something similar, we need someone to be in charge of running it. We have the base of a Discord bot available, though we still need to decide on the scope of the project. Christian suggested starting with recreating react-roles, and then seeing what we want to do once we get there.\nA game, while sounding good, seems like it would be a little too much for us to be able to handle at once. Working on a Discord bot would allow us to be more modular with its development, allowing us to keep the tasks small and manageable.\nSome features mentioned to consider developing for the Discord bot:\nUsing react-roles (main feature to start on, has utility) Playing tic-tac-toe with users Knowing the solved states of tic-tac-toe (impossible to win against) Playing rock-paper-scissors GitHub Student Developer Pack Note Since some students have old IDs (prior to the rebranding), the signup process may not accept their application if the student uses their ID. Instead, you can take a picture of your student profile in Student Self-Service. This will also be reiterated during the GitHub presentation in the first meeting.\nNext Week We plan on having some LeetCode problems (easy and medium) to sift through and decide which ones we want to keep for meetings during the spring semester.\nNext week\u0026rsquo;s meeting will take place virtually.

He discussed the basics of Docker, and provided a live demo using his own implementation of a basic server.\nDocker Docker is used to install and run applications on a containerized file system. These containers usually run a Linux distribution. Some people compare containers to virtual machines. However, containers are much more lightweight than a VM, and is usually interfaced by a terminal.\nPaul proposed a full-stack application for users to create an account, sign in, and modify settings. Users may also view, upload, and delete posts. This server will be managed using Docker. Each of these actions will be associated with an API endpoint.\nIssues Paul discussed the downsides of using a single container to manage all API endpoints. He mentioned the following complications:\nNew features may break existing ones Hard to monitor resources Thousands of APIs in one codebase is difficult to manage. Vulnerable to DDoS attacks. If one API is \u0026ldquo;abused\u0026rdquo;, it may affect all other APIs. Group Related APIs Paul\u0026rsquo;s solution is to use multiple Docker containers. Related APIs will be grouped in one container. He decided to separate our APIs into the following groups.\nImage features Authentication features User-settings features This implementation solves a few issues with the first approach.\nFeature updates won\u0026rsquo;t break other features Easier to monitor resources for related APIs Databases may determine the type of API endpoint it receives. The codebase is easier to understand. How are Containers Made? A Docker File is a text file of instructions to generate a docker image.\nSpecify the programs to install Specify commands to run A Docker Image is the \u0026ldquo;blueprint\u0026rdquo; for creating multiple containers. Once a container is created, you can launch and use it. Docker File Syntax Here is an example of Docker File syntax.\nFROM python:3.11 ADD requirements.txt . RUN pip install -r requirements.txt ADD src/* /home/app FROM specifies a dependency. ADD copies a file from your project to the container. RUN executes a terminal command in the container.\nLive Demo Paul showcased a live demo of Docker. He provided a back-end and database as microservices. He shown us the server logs and terminal output from the Docker GUI.\nDocker Compose Docker Compose is a composition of multiple related Docker Containers. These details are stored as one YML file. Here are some details you may provide for each container.\nImage Container name Build command Ports Environment Dependencies.

However, there has been no confirmation from Erie Insurance at this time. Git Discussion Background Git is a local binary that runs on your computer. Git is a software solution for version control. The purpose of Git is to save the current state of your entire directory. GitHub and BitBucket are examples of cloud hosting services. These services make it very easy to share your code. The concept is similar to a tree structure. People edit their \u0026ldquo;nodes\u0026rdquo;, and merge the updates together, into the master branch. Installing Git on Windows Download Git for Windows here In the installer, most default options will suffice. (Exception: Vim is the default text editor. We do not recommend this option. Select VS Code from the drop-down menu.) After navigating the installer, open your command-line, and type git. This will ensure it has installed properly. Git Command-Line These commands will be entered via command-line. (Hint: use dir and cd C:\\go\\to\\this\\directory commands to navigate to your desired folder)\ngit init This will setup your current directory with git. Use this command FIRST to setup a project in a local, newly created folder!\ngit clone https://github.com/link/to/a/repo This will download a project from a cloud hosting service, like GitHub.\ngit config --global user.name \u0026quot;My Name\u0026quot; Set your global username. Required for the Git GUI in VS Code.\ngit config --global user.email \u0026quot;Email@Email.com\u0026quot; Set your global email. Required for the Git GUI in VS Code.\ngit status Retrieves information about your project. (Such as the current branch you are using)\ngit add * Prepares all untracked (newly created) files to be committed. Typically, you would do this before a commit.\ngit commit -m \u0026quot;Here is a basic summary of my newest contributions.\u0026quot; Commits all tracked files, along with a message. Ideally, the message should provide relevant information.\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/pwsdc/example-repo Upload a local repository to a new GitHub repository.\ngit push Upload your local changes to GitHub. Ensure your local repository is connected to a GitHub repository, using the command provided above.\nGit Integration with VS Code When you open VS code, focus on the left-most panel. There should be an icon for \u0026ldquo;source control\u0026rdquo; (The icon resembles a tree with nodes). The GUI will provide ways to initialize Git, add untracked files, commit changes, and push commits. The GUI is much more user friendly, but the console is much more powerful. Members Made Pull Requests Everyone was encouraged to pull request to the Resources repository in the club organization. We received contributions from mwilliams52000, BrandonM03, and DTBdude, where Karl merged their changes into the master branch. Game Ideas Christian suggested a fighting game against the three mascots from the three campuses. He suggested that we would need a game engine. There were suggestions to use M.U.G.E.N. We looked into GitHub to find a pre-build project to use as a base. Votes No votes were held this meeting.\nAgenda for Next Meeting (Sep 14 2023) Karl and Paul will not be present during the meeting. They will be attending the club fair, in hopes to promote the club. Christian plans to prepare a PowerPoint presentation on VS Code, and continue the discussion for our game idea.

Discussions Overview Karl introduced the officers of the club: Himself as President, Christian as Vice President, and Paul as Treasurer. Karl nominated Luke for Secretary, Jon seconded. The club will vote on this nomination next week. Additional nominations can be submitted to Karl or mentioned in the Discord. This is an interim election to replace the previous Secretary who transferred. Karl discussed the reasoning for re-branding the \u0026ldquo;Programming Club\u0026rdquo; as the \u0026ldquo;Software Development Club\u0026rdquo;. We needed to broaden the scope of the club to a bigger audience. Art majors, Business majors, CIS majors, and CS majors - anyone interested in software development - are welcome additions to the club. Members briefly introduced themselves. Karl discussed the GitHub repository. We recommend creating a personal GitHub account and joining the club repo at https://github.com/pwsdc. Christian pointed out that the club must tailor to the interests of its members. Suggestions Christian suggested tutoring intro classes. Running another code jam eventually. Possibly over a longer period, like a week, and with more open ended topics. May be a task for a future semester. A Discord moderator for the server. Christian wants to help with debugging. Jeremiah suggests to contribute to pre-existing open source projects. Jon suggests a text-based MUD. Abu suggests a Zelda-esque game / crawler with a card game mechanic. Robert wants to explore resources for deployment. Jeremiah mentioned getting involved with the Discord bot. Discussed getting merchandise. Pending Events Meetings, Q\u0026amp;A with alumni. Event with PTC at some point. Explore open source software repositories. LeetCode problems. Member and/or officer presentations on tech subjects of interest. Pizza party next week. May be held in a different room, over concerns of food near computer equipment. Members should use their real names on the discord server. Votes No votes were held this meeting.

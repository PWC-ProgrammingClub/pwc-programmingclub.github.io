To become a current member of the club, you must attend at least two weekly meetings or events in the semester. If you have any extenuating circumstances, let an officer know. 

# Weekly Meetings

Meetings are held in Eberly 342, Thursdays at 11:00 AM EST. You may also join via Discord voice chat, if the "Club Meeting VC" channel is not open let an officer know.

# Discord

Our Discord server is where information about the club is posted and where communication outside of weekly meetings occur. This is our "central hub" for the club. Here is the link:

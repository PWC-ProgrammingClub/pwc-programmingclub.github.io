# Origin

Software Development Club was founded as the Programming Club in 2019. The club's initial goal was to provide a space for Cal U Computer Science students to hang out and get help with their assignments. Since then, we have broadened our scope to spreading software development to everyone.

## Founding Officers

* Paul Maclean
* Anthony Carrola
* Ryan Merow
* Michael Gorse

# Our Mission

Software development is an often misunderstood field. Many feel that they wouldn't be good enough or that it's only programming. These are misconceptions; the truth is that software development is for everyone! Programming is certainly a core component, but so is design, marketing, business, management, and more. Our goal is to provide a space for everyone interested in any aspect of software development.

# What We Offer

To facilitate our mission, we offer several opportunities to get involved:

* **Weekly Meetings**
  * Weekly Meetings will be held at least once a week during the Fall and Spring semesters at PennWest California. 
  * Any in-person meetings will also be available virtually via Discord voice chat (let an officer know if you intend on attending virtually).
  * The point of weekly meetings is to allow for learning, exploration, and discussion in a relaxed environment. 
  * Some activities we've done during weekly meetings include exploration of topics, coding challenge problems, field trips, workshops, and games/contests.
* **Events**
  * We aim to have at least one event during each semester. These will be on a larger-scale than weekly meetings, with the goal of greater exploration and collaboration.
  * A notable event we've done is a Code Jam, where participants come up with a solution for a given prompt.
  * Participants will have the chance to win prizes!
* **Strong Discord Server**
  * Our Discord Server is one of our greatest assets due to its vast network of current students and alumni.
  * If you have any question about software development, there is certainly someone on the Discord who can answer it or point you in the right direction.
  * We highly recommend exploring the channels on the Discord and participating in discussion.

# Club Documents

Documents, such as our consitution, are hosted either on our Engage page or on the Club Discord. Links to both can be found on the *Join the Club* page [here](../join).

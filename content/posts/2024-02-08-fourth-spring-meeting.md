## Resume/Internships Presentation
We plan to have someone from the Career center have a presentation and a resume workshop on the 29th this month. Plan to have a resume available to review for a workshop (a good source is [resumake](resumake.io))

Nowadays, resumes are a little different than they used to be. Companies are now getting resumes from all over the world for any roles they post. Because there are just way too many resumes to go through by hand, they use bots to really quickly narrow down the amount of resumes to something manageable by hand.

The first pass generally includes keywords that the job description contains, which are relevant to the role. DO NOT include anything about ethnicity, race, religion, etc. on your resume; companies do not want to be worried about discrimination problems that may arise. 

When creating your resume, reword the job post description; you want your resume to align as closely as possible to the specific position. This takes longer, but will increase your chances of getting a resume through. 

For us (students), put some experience even if it is not necessarily related to the job; it's important that the companies know that you do have some experience with a workplace environment. 

Again for us, our projects section of our resumes will likely be the largest portion of our resumes. Relevant work experience is nice, yes, but projects show off what you are actually capable of. List all of your languages in your skills section; this is an extremely technical field, so the skills section should be large. Your projects should back up each of the skills you list. 

Be ready to talk about anything on your resume, but also don't be afraid to say "I don't know;" it's better than trying to lie your way through something you don't understand. 

For most jobs apart from FAANG companies (and especially for entry-level roles), the technical interview really is only there to ensure that you know the basics well. 

After sending in a resume for a role, wait about 2-3 weeks for a response. If there hasn't been one, reach out and ask about it / continue to show interest in the role. This can help boost your chances of being selected for an interview.

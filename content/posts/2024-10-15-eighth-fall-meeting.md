# Playdate Progress
Lavender made a pull request adding ship movement, which was lightly discussed. 
# Firefox CVE 9.8 Zero-Day
We watched a video about a recent use-after-free bug in Firefox that allowed remote code execution. It was quickly fixed, but be sure that you're on the most up-to-date version of Firefox (if you use it). 
# Code Jam Idea
Near the end of the meeting, Jon brought up the idea of having a timed code jam. The officers are considering having one, but have yet to figure out the details. 
# Next Week
We'll be meeting during the same time as usual, Tuesday from 5-6pm.

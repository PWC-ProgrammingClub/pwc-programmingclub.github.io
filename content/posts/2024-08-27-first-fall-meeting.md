# Club Introduction
## About SDC
We love everything related to developing software! We were founded in 2019, with the goal of helping CS students with classes, but now we're more focused on doing things outside of the usual class material (though we're fully open to helping anyone who needs it).
## Naming
We're known by both Programming club and Software Development club; the two are synonymous. 
## Why Software Development
Software development is everywhere, even for non-CS students. It's very helpful for automating repetitive actions, for example.
## What You'll Learn
We're going to be exploring a variety of topics, including:
- Version control
- Group collaboration
- The Lua programming language
- Using Git and GitHub
- Linux and its distros
## Meet the Officers
Paul Shriner
- President
- (was catching up from previous section, paul remind me what you said)

Matthew Williams
- Vice president
- Did game development in HS

Lavender Wilson
- Secretary
- Takes notes, won't be talking much during meetings
- Unusual hobbies include building keyboards and speedcubing

Abu Shettima
- Treasurer
- Will introduce himself next time, was unable to speak through Discord

To stay transparent, all of our officer meetings will be held on Discord voice channels (we'll do our best to put notifications in \#club-meeting-chat for when we do so)
# The Playdate
The Playdate is a modern take on the GameBoy; it has a monochrome screen, a similar control scheme (d-pad, a, and b button), it has gyroscopic sensors, and an analog crank on the right side. 

We plan on making a few Playdate games/projects as a club; all the resources to develop for it are free online, and it has in-depth documentation. 

Through these projects, we'll teach club members how to properly use Git and GitHub, as well as good practices for contributing to group projects. 
## Demo Game
The projects that we'll be working on as a club will be available publicly on the [SDC GitHub organization](https://github.com/pwsdc) (the runner game the officers made over the summer is under the `playdate-runner` repository). 
# Next Week
Next time we'll be getting members' environments set up so that they can download, edit, and run sample Playdate games on their systems. We'll be primarily using VSCode for this, as it has some nice features that make developing easier. 

The meeting will take place **5-6PM** on **Tuesday, September 3rd**.

# Passionate Topics
Last meeting, we (the officers) were tasked with brainstorming topics we are passionate about. Here is what we came up with:

* Cyber Security / Privacy
* Jailbreaking / Rooting
* JRPG / RPG Maker / Retro Gaming / Retro Computers

We decided to focus on retro gaming, as there are many possibilities given by the subject matter. Of course, the other topics could still be good for singular meetings. 

# Gameboy/Playdate
We need to have a target platform for which we'd explore. Jon recommends either the Gameboy or the Playdate (a modern indie handheld console), as both have readily available development resources, unlike other platforms such as the NES or SNES.

With the platform chosen, members can make projects to run on it. We will likely need a couple meetings just to cover the development process, then we can break off into actual project development. This will need more thought, as we don't want meetings to get out of hand (a game can quickly spiral out of control due to feature creep).

The benefits from this are numerous. It's rewarding to build a project from the ground up that can actually run on real hardware. The club could use these projects as a way to advertise (hey how'd you make that cool game? oh just join software dev club!) Finally, a published game would look **great** on a resume!

More information about the Playdate can be found on their site [here](https://play.date/). The actual unit costs $199, but they offer an officially supported emulator for free. We decided that we would start purely on the emulator, then if interest is high enough, we can buy the real unit.

# Presentations
Jon discussed that you need to be passionate about what you're covering in a presentation, as it will show if you're not. Further, he brought up some bad presentation habits, including being too rigid, too quiet, and not being able to adapt to change. This is something the officers (particularly Paul and Matt) will need to work on. 

As this is a club, it does not need to (and should not be) too professional. It's a good chance to learn and experiment (and as Jon said, embarrass yourself). We can also just ask if there's areas we need to work on, people want to help!

# Next Week
For next week, the officers will research Gameboy and Playdate development. We encourage anyone who will be coming next semester to stop by the next meeting to offer your feedback on our ideas. The meeting day/time will be posted closer to the meeting.

# Meeting Overview

Paul Shriner, treasurer of the Software Development Club, created a presentation on the Demoscene. We watched some Commodore 64 and Amiga demos.

## The Demoscene

This is a worldwide community of programmers who create "computer demos". This niche began in the 1980s, and was popular among retro computers and consoles.

## Techniques

Sometimes, programmers must be creative when designing complex programs on retro computers, given memory and speed constraints. Here are a few methods programmers would use to develop impressive demos.
- **Raster interrupts** were used to render more colors on the screen. While the computer renders each horizontal line of pixels, you may execute a raster interrupt to override the color palette for the next line to use.
- **Speedcode** were techniques used to optimize assembler instructions. For instance, repeated lines of code execute faster than using a "Jump" instruction.

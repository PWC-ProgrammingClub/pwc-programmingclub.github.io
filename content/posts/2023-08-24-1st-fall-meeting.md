# Discussions

## Overview

- Karl introduced the officers of the club: Himself as President, Christian as Vice President, and Paul as Treasurer.
- Karl nominated Luke for Secretary, Jon seconded. The club will vote on this nomination next week. Additional nominations can be submitted to Karl or mentioned in the Discord. This is an interim election to replace the previous Secretary who transferred.
- Karl discussed the reasoning for re-branding the "Programming Club" as the "Software Development Club". We needed to broaden the scope of the club to a bigger audience. Art majors, Business majors, CIS majors, and CS majors - anyone interested in software development - are welcome additions to the club.
- Members briefly introduced themselves.
- Karl discussed the  GitHub repository. We recommend creating a personal GitHub account and joining the club repo at https://github.com/pwsdc.
- Christian pointed out that the club must tailor to the interests of its members.

## Suggestions

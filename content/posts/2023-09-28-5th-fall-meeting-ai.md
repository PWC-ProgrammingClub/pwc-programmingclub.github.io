# Meeting Overview

Jakob Korber presented his commercial product named *Right Click Composer*. It is an AI image generator implemented as a browser extension. This application took approximately a month to build. The service will cost $3 a month with no additional restrictions, but he generously provided club members with free lifetime access. 

Jakob discussed the app's various features, and provided a live demo of the app. The most common use case is right-clicking an image in the web browser, and selecting "generate image".

You may download the extension on [Right Click Composer's homepage](http://rightclickcomposer.com/).

# Primary Features

Here is a list of the primary generative features.
- **Image-to-Image**: Output based on a reference image, description, and a weight.
- **Super resolution**: Upscale an image based on a URL.
- **Quick access**: Users may generate an image directly from the web-browser's context menu.
- **Advanced settings**: Users may provide additional parameters for generating an image.

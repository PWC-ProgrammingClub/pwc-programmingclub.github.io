# Discussions

### Logo and Rebranding

Luke shared some first draft logos.

Karl liked the first logo a lot.

{{< figure align=center src=/img/luke_draft_1_logo.png title="Luke 1st Draft Type 1 Logo (2D)" >}}

The consensus was that the second logo was better.

{{< figure align=center src=/img/luke_draft_2_logo.png title="Luke 1st Draft Type 2 Logo (Psuedo-3D)" >}}

It was suggested that the 2nd one be modeled in a 3D modeler before generating a final SVG and some of the perspective lines got fixed. Both logos were big hits and we are excited about them.

### Presentations

We talked about getting content for the semester by doing presentations. Heather, though she is transferring, said she could do a weekend remote presentation, perhaps on Notion or debugging generally.

The hardest classes students will take next semester are COBOL, Fortran, and Analysis of Algorithms; presentations adjacent to the content from those classes should be considered.

### Calendar

Seems to be working well so far.

### Treasury

- SAI is open over the summer
- SAI closes at 4:00 PM
- They would be able to tell us what our budget is
- We will shoot them an email asking about the budget
- We have to figure out about changing rooms

### Discord Bot

- Karl will do a meeting Thursday @5:00 on the Discord bot, but he will first cover Docker, because the bot uses Docker. Discord bot will be addressed only if there is time.

### Weekend Meetings

During the semester, there will be free-form chat meetings during weekends, maybe the occasional workshop.

### Meeting Next Week

Friday @ 5:00 PM (Voted 5-0)

### Pizza Party Planning

- Christian recommends we NOT go through AVI (very expensive)
- We may not have to if we move to Eberly
- It may be easiest to get paid back for pizza. Generally SAI only pre-pays if you order through AVI, get a Wal-Mart card, or order online. However, we may be able to order pizza online.

### Website

- Christian will send links for the other April Fools Jam submissions so we can host those.
- We would like to put more history of the club in an about page
    - Paul from Discord started the club
    - We should list founding officers and any other former officers
- Christian would be down to switch website framework to React or Angular
- Karl still doesn't have appropriate Discord permissions

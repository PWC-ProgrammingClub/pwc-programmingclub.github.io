# Playdate Development

We discovered a useful web tool called [Pulp](https://play.date/pulp/), a game maker for easily creating Playdate games. It includes a visual tile editor, scripting, music editing, and more. 

Lavender briefly showed off their progress on a small demo game (a simple music playing game). The project will be made available soon on [their GitHub page](https://github.com/lavender-aa?tab=repositories).

# Club Advertising/Merchandising

We discussed some forms of apparel/merchandise for promoting the club (these could be given out during club fairs and events, or possibly sold):

- Stickers - we think they're a good idea, but need to finalize details such as design, quantity, and cost, possibly with SAI's help.

- Flash Drives - customizing them with stickers ourselves seems like a cost-effective approach (compared to using a paid service).

# Other Discussion

We proposed a couple of event ideas:

- Club Expo - we decided it's not feasible yet. If we get many smaller projects done this semester, we could revisit doing one next semester.

- Hackathon - it would have to be called something else (it caused an event not to happen in a previous semester) but the idea would be similar. 

A good way to attract people to an event is through free stuff (such as food); people who are interested in the club can stay and learn more. 

To further promote the club, we could do something in Natali to grab the attention of passersby. 

# Next Week

Our next meeting will be on **Monday, June 17th** at **7 PM**.

# Playdate Development
We found that there's a pretty nice web tool called [Pulp](https://play.date/pulp/) that is essentially an entire game engine for easily making games for the Playdate. It includes things like a visual tile editor, a scripting portion, a music editor, and some other things. 
Lavender briefly showed off their progress in the small demo game they're working on, which is a simple music playing game. The project will be made available soon on [their GitHub page](https://github.com/lavender-aa?tab=repositories).
# Club Advertising/Merchandising
We had some general discussion surrounding stickers (primarily to give out during club fairs and other events). We think they could be a good idea, but we will need to figure out the details (what to print, how many, estimated cost), likely involving the SAI for help. We think that other merchandising such as apparel or thumb drives could be good as well. 
If we do decide to do thumb drives, we think that putting stickers on them would probably be the easiest way to customize them at a low cost. 
# Other Discussion
An event like an expo was proposed, but we currently don't have much to show off. Maybe if we get a lot of smaller projects done this semester we could have one next semester, but it'd be a lot of work. 
We also talked about how having some kind of big event, something like a hackathon (not named that way, since it caused the event not to happen in a previous semester). A good way to get people to come to an event is to advertise free stuff (food works especially well), and then the people who are interested in the club can stay and learn more. 
We talked about possibly doing something in Natali to garner more attention from people passing by. 
# Next Week
We'll be having a meeting on the same day and time next week (**Monday, June 17th** at **7 PM**).

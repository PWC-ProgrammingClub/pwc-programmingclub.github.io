## Why You Should Try C#
### Short History
- Microsoft engineers wanted to develop more features for Java
	- They were denied, so they decided to make a new language
- Originally named 'cool', renamed for copyright
- Wanted more features to add onto the JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
### .NET
- Essentially the same as JRE
- Currently up to .NET Core 8, .NET 4 in LTS (long-term support)
### Why Should You Use It?
- It's a very general purpose OOP lanugage
- Supports implicitly typed variables (`var` keyword)
- Has massive support for many libraries with package manager
- Supports strong structure using namespaces
- Much less verbose than Java
- Has very good Intellisense (both made by Microsoft)
### Examples
POJO (Plain Old Java Object)
``` C#
namespace DTC.Model {
	public class User {
		// no need to implement getter and setter
		public String Username{get; set;}
		
		// ... other fields here
	}
}
```

# Git and VSCode adoption
We discussed inviting several professors to a club meeting in order to convince them to advocate for teaching students how to use Git (and maybe GitHub or another online repo storage provider), as well as adopting VSCode (instead of Dev-C++) as the primary text editor that students use. 

There are so many benefits of making these changes, and not implementing them keeps current students in the past in terms of what software/technology they'll actually be using once they get a job. 

Christian and Paul are going to be working together to amend the 'Git' and 'Why Dev-C++ is Bad' presentations to show to professors sometime in April, before the school board meeting.

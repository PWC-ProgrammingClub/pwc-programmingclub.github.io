# IDEs
## Why use an IDE?
Maybe a little obvious, but using an IDE makes writing and debugging programs much faster and easier. 
## Use VSCode!
(That is, if you haven't decided on an editor yet.) 

VSCode is very ubiquitously used, and it has one of the largest extension libraries -- you can pretty quickly set it up for almost any language. 

It also has good Git and GitHub integration (the web version is actually used as a text editor in GitHub, which is pretty neat). 
# Exploring VSCode
## Extensions
The extensions are the biggest part of VSCode, and you'll definitely be installing many of them if you use it as your main code editor.

You can browse some popular extensions, but the extensions we'll be using for Playdate development are Playdate (by Orta) and Playdate Debug (by midouest). 
## Settings
VSCode has a lot of settings, and most of them you'll never end up touching. Most of the time, you'll have a specific goal in mind when you change some of the more obscure settings. 
## Themes
There are a large variety of themes on the marketplace that you can check out. 
# Playdate SDK
## Setting it Up
You can find instructions on how to install the Playdate SDK (and include it in your PATH) in the readme in [this repository](https://github.com/pwsdc/playdate-runner) (which is the place where we developed our little runner game).

The SDK and its documentation are free to use under their [license agreement](https://play.date/dev/sdk-license/). 
# Next Week
Next Week's meeting will be on **Tuesday**, **September 10th**, from **5-6 p.m.**

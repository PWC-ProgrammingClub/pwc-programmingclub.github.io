## Malware Presentation

### What is Malware?

Malware stands for "malicious software", and refers to any software that is harmful or intrusive. 
Malware:
- Has been around since the beginning of computing
- Early malware had a style reminiscent of the demoscene
- Has evolved with computing 
	- (started with copying via disks, now often travel through the internet)

### Types of Malware

- __Virus__: Code that copies itself into other files and programs, allowing it to spread
- __Worm__: Similar to a virus, but can spread without the need of a human to enable it.
- __Ransomware__: Software that encrypts your data and demands payment as a ransom
- __Adware__: Displays unwanted advertisements
- __Spyware__: Gathers information about the user unknowingly
- __Rootkit__: Hides the existence of malware in a system

People tend to assume that malware will always destroy your computer; while they can, generally they pursue more nefarious means (such as stealing data or holding a system for ransom). 

### Viruses

- Creeper
	- First ever computer virus
	- Created as a proof of concept
- Elk Cloner, Brain
	- First viruses to get out into the wild

Viruses can be as creative as they are destructive.
Viruses are not as popular now, mainly because security has gotten much better.

### Worms

- ILOVEYOU (2000)
	- You would get an email with the subject "ILOVEYOU," and an attachment with a supposed love letter
- Code Red (2001)
	- Specifically targeted systems running IIS for Windows Server
- Blaster (2003)
	- Exploited a known vulnerability in Windows 2000 and XP
	- Millions were affected, including government services
	- Buffer overflow would cause the system to reboot every so often
	- Worms such as Sasser and Blaster showed how unsecure Windows was then

### Ransomware

- WannaCry (2017)
	- Used an exploit called EternalBlue to get into Windows computers
	- Encrypts files and demands Bitcoin payment

### Brief History of Antivirus

- Reaper
	- First antivirus
	- Designed to remove Creeper
- McAfee VirusScan
	- First widespread antivirus
	- Created in 1987 by John McAfee
- Several antivirus solutions have since came out from ESET, Avast, Kaspersky, Norton, and more
- Some antivirus solutions are worse than the malware they prevent

### How is Malware Made?

- It's just computer code, except that it's malicious
- It must be able to succeed and spread

### How to Protect Yourself

- Keep your software up to date
- Make sure you have an antivirus and firewall
- Practice safe habits (eg. be suspicious of files)
	- uBlock Origin (ad and tracker blocker) is useful on web browsers

## Next Week

We'll be doing a presentation about code documentation next week, same day and time as usual.

# Meeting
Once again, most of our officers were busy (primarily with their senior projects), so today we had another general discussion day. 
## Elections
All positions except Secretary were uncontested; here are the results from elections (secretary was decided based on an in-person vote):
- President: Paul Shriner
- VP: Matthew Williams
- Treasurer: Abu Shettima
- Secretary: Lavender Wilson
## Club Direction
We discussed what kinds of things that we want the club to be for. Some items that were mentioned:
- Having some small supplimental instruction (eg. Git/Github)
- Providing help for specific courses
- Sharing personal projects and collaboration
- Branching out a little bit to related topics (such as watching movies or playing games)
- Revisiting code jams
- Bringing back a club-wide, semester-long project
## Billion Row Challenge
A programming challenge; you are given a file with 1 billion rows. Each row contains a station name and a double with a value. You have to calculate min, mean, and max for each different weather station.

It came up in discussion as a potential option for a semester-long club project.

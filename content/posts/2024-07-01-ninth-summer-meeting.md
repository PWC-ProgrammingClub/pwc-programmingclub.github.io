# General Discussion
## AI and LLMs
### As tools/workflows
Luke talked a little bit about incorporating Copilot into his programming work. He noted that it's important to treat it with caution and not letting it do too much for you. 
### Predictions for the future
While some people may make it seem like AI will completely take over certain types of jobs, it is highly unlikely that it will end up as more than just another tool to developers.

LLMs (large language models) are not much more than overpowered text predictors, and they draw their responses from a huge amount of data scraped from the internet. 
# Playdate Project
## Getting Started
For the development process, Jon reccommended having a more stage-style approach (working on the most important things first, and then branching off into the smaller details). 

He also reccommends using todo/kanban lists to clearly outline what all needs to be done. 

Having a specific design document will be very helpful to avoid misunderstandings with details; we'll most likely have a shared Word document describing them. 
## Dividing Work
To both keep track of what needs to be done as well as divide the work among the officers, we'll try to have a Trello board (or some other similar service, kanban-style). 
# Next Week
Over this next week, the officers will iron out the specifics for the game. 

Our next meeting will be on **Monday**, **July 8** at **7 PM**.

## Senior Projects
Two groups quickly presented their senior project slides to the club.
### DeckTechCentral
DTC is a Magic: The Gathering deck list management system. It aims to allow experienced players to build their own decks.
### Assignment Tracker
AT is an Android app written in Java and Kotlin that allows students to input courses and assignments. Assignments can be paired with courses and given priorities. A lack of organization is a demotivator for students, so providing calendar planners can help students focus on their work. 
## Next Week
Good luck on finals next week! This week's meeting was the last official meeting of the semester, and we will not be having any official club meeting next week. We will make plans to meet over the summer, but the details have yet to be decided.

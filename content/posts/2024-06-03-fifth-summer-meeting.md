# Playdate/GameBoy Development
We found that there were a few options for GameBoy development, mainly concerning the following: 
- Developing programs in ASM
- Developing programs in C (particularly the GameBoy Development Kit)
- Developing via a more visual IDE (GBStudio)  

We found that jumping straight in (with C) wasn't bad, and thought that going the ASM route would probably be a bad move. We also thought that GBStudio could be a good route due to its ease of access/use as a more visual IDE.  

For playdate development, it seemed that getting started and using the SDK was much easier than expected, so it may be a good choice that many people can more easily get started with. 

Abu shared an idea for a game combining details from trivia games and RPGs, where the player would be asked a trivia question and then the correctness of the answer would influence the following RPG section, which is an interesting idea.  

For GameBoy development in general, we think that it could be the harder route to go since the hardware is older, especially considering that a generally lower level route is less accessible to newer members. We think that going the high-level route (the PlayDate route) would be in the better interests for the club as a whole.  

While lua is the primary language for developing things on the PlayDate, C is also available for those who wish to use it, so by going this route we don't necessarily sacrifice the ability to go low-level.  

Now that we've decided to develop something for the PlayDate, we need to brainstorm some smaller projects to work on. Ideas that are simple but buildable upon are the kinds of projects that we want. 

Here are some ideas that popped up (not necessarily the scope that we want):  
- Abu's RPG idea (above)
- Some other kind of retro-styled game

# PlayDate and Lua Resources

# Next Week
The officers' assignment is to look further into development for the PlayDate, as well as focusing on a specific area to improve their skills and experience with. The areas to look into included graphics, sound, logic, and data structures.  

For next week, we'll be having a meeting at the same time and day (**Monday, June 10th** at **7 PM**).

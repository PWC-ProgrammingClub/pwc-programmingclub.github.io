## Academic Calendar/Meetings Overview

There are 11 weeks of meetings to fill. Some ideas discussed:

- Doing a meeting discussing/helping with assembly
- Creating some extra meeting ideas just in case something happens
- Cooperation with Career Center
	- A "make the most from your internship" presentation
- Helping underclassmen with difficult assignments (more of a general point)
- Interest with having Highmark and/or PTC present
- A smaller code gym with easier questions
- Having a day of code golf

## Next Week

Because of the holiday, a meeting will not take place. Thursday around 5:00 P.M. EST. was discussed as an option, but was dismissed. The next meeting will take place on Thursday, December 28th, at 5:00 P.M. EST. There will be announcements from now on (this meeting was rushed). Announcements will be a day before and 30 minutes before the meetings.

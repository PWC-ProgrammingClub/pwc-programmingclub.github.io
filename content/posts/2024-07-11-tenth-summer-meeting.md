# Playdate Progress/Direction
## Prototype
Paul showed off a prototype of the game that he made. It is very simple, using a sprite from one of the examples; the focus was on the core elements of the game (running, jumping, spawning and hitting objects).
## Continuing Development
For now, we plan on version controlling this project so that we can present it at the club fair. We'll have a stable branch that is ready to play/present at any time, and feature branches that will have what is currently being worked on. 

The project will be tracked on the club's [GitHub page](https://github.com/pwsdc/playdate-runner). 
## Responsibilities
For now, Lavender has agreed to work on the player physics, and Matt wanted to work on adding ducking.
# Next Week
Next week's meeting will be on **Monday**, **July 15th** at **7 PM**.

# Meeting Overview

- Christian created a PowerPoint presentation on VS Code, and why it is objectively better than Dev-C++.

# Downsides of Dev-C++

- "Dev-C++" is an IDE recommended by our professors for assignments. It "just works" for most people, but there are **objectively better options**. 
- **This IDE lacks basic features**: Bare-bones syntax highlighting, no git integration, no extensions, and barely supports code completion.
- **There is one notorious bug**: The undo/redo tree may become corrupt, causing your file to become slightly corrupt. Be careful!
- **There are better options**: They offer more features for productivity and convenience.

# We Recommend VS Code

- "Visual Studio Code" (VS Code) is a cross platform text editor.
- Do not confuse it with the "Visual Studio" IDE!
- Supports many programming languages!

# Compiling in VS Code

## Prerequisites for Compiling C or C++

- You must use the terminal to compile and run your code. This may be slightly less convenient than Dev-C++'s "run" button. However, familiarity with the terminal is a valuable skill to know!
- [Install the GCC compiler](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/) on your computer.
- Setup your environment variables for Windows.
- Validate by running the command `gcc --version`.

## Compile C or C++

To compile C code, run the command `gcc main.c -o program.exe`
To compile C++ code, run the command `g++ main.cpp -o program.exe`
To run your code, run the command `.\program.exe`

# Migrate from Dev-C++ to VS Code

- Open VS Code.
- Go to `File -> Open Folder`.
- Locate your Dev-C++ project folder. (Containing the source files)
- Select that folder.

# Votes

- No votes were held this meeting.

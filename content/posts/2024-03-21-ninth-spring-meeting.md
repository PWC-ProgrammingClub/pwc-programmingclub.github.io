## Discussion and Exploration of Generative AI

Today's meeting was a more laid back meeting where we looked at examples of Generative AI, as well as discussed how they are impacting the field of Software Development.

### Blackbox AI

[Blackbox AI](https://www.blackbox.ai/) has several preconfigured options suited to certain prompts. During the meeting, we looked at one for MongoDB, which seemed to produce accurate results.

### Devin AI

[Devin AI](https://preview.devin.ai/) is portrayed as a "software engineer for hire", and has received attention due to its ability to pass software engineering interviews and correctly answer problems. We were not able to explore it as it requires access to use.

### Will Generative AI take away developers' jobs?

We do not believe so. While Generative AI is a great tool and will certainly change how software development is done, it will not replace actual humans. AI is not able to reproduce the creativity and imagination that a human has. 

### Generative AI's Impact on Applying for Jobs

Luke Bates, former secretary of PWSDC, shared an interesting video in the Club Discord: [Software Engineers REAL problem with AI and Jobs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQmN6xSorus) by Internet of Bugs. This video submits that Generative AI is already making the job application process harder by flooding recruiters with AI-generated resumes. The AI is used to go through the job application and pick out key words to put in the resumes, in order to make the person look more qualified. This ends up making it harder for real people to be noticed; recruiters have to filter through potentially hundreds of AI-generated resumes.

The solution presented in the video is to go "old-school", by actually communicating with a real human instead of applying electronically through a website. Doing this will ensure you get noticed and potentially moved further in the application process. Examples like this show the adaptations we will have to make in the face of ever-changing technology.

### Dr. Menon's Recommendation

Our advisor, Dr. Menon, recommeneded taking a course in Generative AI. She feels it is more beneficial to learn and adapt to it, rather than trying to fight it. We will post links to Generative AI courses in the Club Discord.

## Next Week

Frank Santos, a recruiter from the PA Auditor General's office, will be coming to PennWest to discuss job and internship opportunities! More information will be posted on the Club Discord.

# Asteroids Progress
Matthew presented his changes to the club. He added the ability to rotate the ship using the crank, where the position of the crank is directly related to the rotation of the ship. We discussed specific details surrounding the changes, and talked about what could be better. 
# Next Week
We'll be continuing work on the project the same day and time next week (Tuesday, 5-6).

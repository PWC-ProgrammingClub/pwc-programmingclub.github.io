# Playdate Progress
This week mainly consisted of discussion around specific things for the project, as well as reviewing some PRs that Lavender made. 
## Next Things
A few next steps were discussed:
- Making a simple menu
- Fleshing out the shooting system
- Sound effects
- Ducking under obstacles
# Club Collaboration
We discussed what clubs/organizations we could likely do something with. Some of the clubs mentioned:
- Gaming club
- Robotics club
- Career Advancement Club
# Fall Meeting Times
We have not officially decided on a usual club meeting time for the upcoming semester. The general idea was that it should probably be later in the day on a Tuesday, so we are currently aiming to have meetings on **Tuesdays** at **5 PM**. We're not sure yet where (if not online), and we're open to suggestions and/or feedback.
## Other Meetings
While we plan on mainly having one meeting per week, we are also considering having another (likely smaller/shorter) meeting for anyone who is interested. 

We're also thinking about making it easier to be present at meetings over discord (or some other online service) for anyone who would prefer that method (ex. commuters).
## Meeting Room Discussion
We think it could be nice to switch up the meeting location, since students may not want to go to their usual classrooms. We also discussed having a one-off meeting location every once in a while (ex. in the Natali commons).
# Next Week
We'll have our meeting on **Monday**, **July 22nd** at **7 PM**.

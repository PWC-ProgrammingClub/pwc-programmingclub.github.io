## Applying for an internship

- Apply for Software Engineer Intern [here](https://career4.successfactors.com/sfcareer/jobreqcareerpvt?jobId=43544&company=ERIEPROD&st=E7153D62DAAC61E31ECAEEB14AFF869684C2FAAB).
- Apply for Information Technology Intern [here](https://career4.successfactors.com/sfcareer/jobreqcareerpvt?jobId=43545&company=ERIEPROD&st=3FB280161063BA0A633ADDCD1C8B46E8E3B1A14C).
- A bachelor's degree student should have completed at least their sophomore year at the start of the internship.
- Sophomores and junior applicants are preferred. Seniors are encouraged to apply for the Erie Insurance Apprenticeship Program instead, by reaching out to Victor Hudson (victor.hudson@erieinsurance.com) directly and sending him their resume.
- During past years, they have had to sort through thousands of applications for the internship program. This year, they are trying to target a select few schools for candidates instead, and ours is one of them!
- It is strongly recommended that perspective candidates submit their applications as early as possible.

# PlayDate Project
We went over the development milestones that were added to the project document during last week's optional meeting. A few minor adjustments were discussed and made, including the possibility of auto-fire and some more stretch goals.

# Next week
By next week, our goal is to hold an optional meeting at some point. The officers will create sprites for the PlayDate project and we will try to display them on screen.

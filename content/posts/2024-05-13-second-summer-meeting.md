# Meeting Agendas
Starting from this meeting, we'll be following the general format of having one or two main discussion topics, and then afterwards dispersing into more scattered/unrelated discussion topics. 
# Constitution
Last week, some of our officers looked at certain sections of our constitution, analyzing and then determining if anything should be adjusted. Some of the sections were relatively simple/less important, and so were skipped. 
Separately, Christian recommends that we focus on only changing the name of the club on the constitution, if not putting our time towards more important topics (such as gaining members in the near future). He also mentioned that, so long as nobody commits any kind of fraud, PennWest does not really enforce club's constitutions very much, especially for smaller clubs. 
## Article 4 - Officers
This article details (or, rather, makes a general description of) the roles, powers, and responsibilities/duties of each of the officers. Discussion turned towards the information not being very descriptive and leaning more towards vagueness (a trend that we noticed throughout the constitution), as well as that our club has not been doing much budget-wise recently. 
## Article 5 - Removal
This section describes how officers may be removed, given that they "fail to perform \[their\] duties." This section is much shorter than we decided it ought to be, and is missing a lot of pertinent information. We intend to expand upon the general scenarios where a vote may be called to remove an officer, as well as expanding upon the process of removal to include a chance for the offending officer to form a rebuttal. 
## Article 6 - Meetings
This section is about the weekly meetings. While vague, this section serves its purpose and leaves flexibility to the officers to decide the rest of the meeting details. We decided that it was likely for the better, especially now that common hour is gone and we need to be more flexible. 
## Article 7 - Quorum
This article details the number/amount of members and officers that must be present in order for a club meeting to take place. It is currently set at 50% of active members with at least 2 officers. We tend to have all 4 officers, and since we have a relatively small active member pool, the 50% minimum is met more often than not. 
## Article 8 - Advisor
This article discusses information surrounding the advisor. We wanted to add that there may be multiple advisors and be more specific about what the advisor should do. We also made note that we currently do not make very much use of our advisor, so reaching out to her for general advice would be a good option. 
# Unguided Discussions
## Fall Meeting Times
As most of us know, most clubs will need to think about new meeting times for club meetings since the common hour was removed. We have previously discussed having in-person and/or hybrid meetings later in the day, most likely on a Tuesday, a Thursday, or maybe both. We plan to have the meetings in the same room as usual, though we discussed potentially having a different room than usual (both because Eberly may not be available later in the day as well as that students may not want to come to club meetings in the same room as their other classes). 
## Club Fair
We discussed some aspects of the club fair, since it pertains to gaining members. We primarily recalled our past few experiences at club fairs, which did not go very well (only getting the interest of about 1 or 2 people each time, and not having much to show off). We want to be more prepared for the next club fair(s), but since they are still a ways away, we decided to discuss strategies and preparation details in a later meeting -- likely coming up naturally from discussing plans to increase membership. 
# Next Meeting
Next week, we'll be focusing much more on general strategies to gain new members. We'll be having our next meeting at the same time next week (8:30 PM on Monday, May 20th).

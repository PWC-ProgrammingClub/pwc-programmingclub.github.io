# Election Speeches
Paul Shriner and Jonathan Buckel, candidates for President, gave brief remarks. 

Paul Shriner, the current President of the club, highlighted their desire for increasing membership numbers by planning more interesting meeting topics. He highlighted a need for facilitating engagement with members by being more inclusive to those who are not officers. His goal for the spring is improving our club's documentation.

Jonathan Buckel, a previous President of the club, wants to focus on activities. He highlighted our lack of numbers, and blamed it on our lack of activities. He pointed to his experience as a tutor for Upward Bound as qualification for coming up with engaging activities. Additionally, he proposed small-scale events that could include things like Code Jams. He wants to offer content for a variety of difficulty levels in order to fully engage with the audience, and focus more on the needs of upper-classmen.

Afterwards, the polls were published on Engage and open for the remainder of the meeting.

# Hugo Website Building
Hugo is a static website builder. It can be used for a personal portfolio, project website, etc. Hugo is free and open-source, unlike other alternatives like Square Space. An example of a Hugo website is our very own club's website. The page you are currently reading is a part of a Hugo website. Web pages on the site are built using markdown files, and it is possible to harness various types of themes and colors. 

### Creating a Website
Paul showcased how to build a site by navigating to the [Hugo Themes Selection](https://themes.gohugo.io/) and selecting the [Terminal Theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/terminal-hugo-theme/). He created a test repo, and then cloned and installed that theme. He created a file called hugo.toml and copy and pasted the configuration file for the terminal theme into it. Then, he typed in the command ```hugo server -D --renderToMemory``` so the website could viewed on a local host. To create a page, he typed in the command ```hugo new posts/test.md``` which creates a markdown file that makes up the content of the page.

### GitHub Pages
It is possible for any person with a GitHub account to create a personal website using Hugo. This [page](https://pages.github.com/) provides more details.

# Election Results
The polls closed at 5:54 PM and these were the results:

Jonathan Buckel - President

Paul Shriner - Vice President

Lavender Wilson - Secretary

Abu Shettima - Treasurer

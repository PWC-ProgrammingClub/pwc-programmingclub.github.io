# Club Direction
We've recently been struggling to retain new members. The current officers seemed to have primarily joined because they were interested in furthering their career and learning things outside of classes, but we think that that approach is not very popular among the majority of students. 

We asked former officers of the club for advice, and they suggested (among many things) that the club should be less formal than we're currently treating it, especially concerning our tendency to have more lecture-type meetings. We greatly appreciate their feedback!

We're considering trying to make club meetings much more friendly/welcoming by greatly reducing the number of presentation meetings (which are rigid and mostly unengaging), and instead encouraging more general discussions and fun activities.

We also want to broaden the scope of our club, especially focusing on more casual social events. However, we will need to be careful not to spread ourselves out too thin. Regardless, the audience we want to appeal to is a newer and less serious audience than the one we're currently poised for.

# Unguided Discussion
## Club Fair Preparations
We aim to start planning for the first club fair in the upcoming semester as soon as possible. We want to have a nice display as well as something to give out; currently, we plan on having stickers with our club logo to give out, but we still need to iron out what exactly we want to put on display. 

## First Week of Fall 2024
We also want to focus efforts on spreading word about the club; we think that word of mouth is a good way to get people to consider joining. We plan on communicating with our advisor and professors to see if they would be willing to help us with members. 

## Flyers
Printing flyers has worked decently well in the past, but we want to make a new flyer that's simpler. The current design is too complicated and wordy, so we plan on iterating on something to make a more effective flyer. 

## Meeting Content/Structure
Since last semester's content didn't seem very engaging to most students, we want to try doing something different for the majority of our meetings. We still will probably have more serious meetings when we have speakers, but we want a much more casual environment for the majority of our meetings. 

Part of creating a more casual and inviting environment could have the officers actively engaging members and encouraging discussion. While having free discussion is great on paper, it can be too easy for one or two people to take all of the talking space and not leave much room for others to jump in to the conversation. 

# Next Week
Since Monday next week is Memorial Day, we don't plan on holding a meeting that day. We aren't sure what day would be good, so we'll be posting an announcement as soon as we know the day and time of the next meeting (and we'll announce 1 day before as usual).

For the contents of next week, we want to start with discussing activities we can have during club meetings that are more aimed towards newer/less experienced members, as well as list out the kinds of things that we're passionate about which we could incorporate into meeting topics.

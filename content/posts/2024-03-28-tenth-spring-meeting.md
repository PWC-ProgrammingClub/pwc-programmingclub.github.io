Sophomores and beyond are capable of applying. Their program is called the "Intern 2 Hire" program; it is designed to be remote, though there are hybrid positions available for those who would want it. Leadership is structured throughout, and mentors will be provided. 

They want you to be minimally qualified (at least 2.5 GPA), and be good at looking at details and at numbers. After being accepted into an internship, you can complete 900 hours on your own time and then they can extend a full-time offer to you once you graduate. 

They emphasize that the schedule is very flexible; the mentor will walk you through basic daily activities (such as putting in time sheets, recording your activites). The IT audit division is completely remote (except for giving presentations like they did today). The process from going from an intern to a full-time employee was easy (for Austin, another speaker). They treat interns more like full employees, and the work-life balance for full-time employees is good. 
### Careers
- Pay increases, incentive programs
- Flexible schedules, work from home options
- Advancement, leadership development opportunities

No current full-time positions posted, but next month some will be made available, as they do need more people. 

Penny's experience (another speaker):  
She started almost exactly one year ago; she applied late December of 2022; she got a reply by January to schedule an interview. Which specific department you are in can affect how hybrid/remote the position is; she usually goes out 2-3 times per week in her department, which she likes doing. She really emphasized that you have a lot of control of how much you go out and how much you stay home, as well as your hours/work day schedule. There are also some student loan forgiveness benefits she commented on after 10 years of service under the PA Commonwealth. 

### Questions
**Q:** Are audits from a security perspective applicable to the IT audit division?  
**A:** They do check certain aspects such as password parameters, reducing access to those who do not need it anymore; there are many standard practices, mainly comprised of automated things. They are very secure in their automated processes, especially since COVID. 

**Q:** Internships are Sophomore minimum; if someone was graduating in the Spring, could they still do the internship before getting a full-time job?  
**A:** Seniors are more than welcome to apply. You have up until 3 months post-graduation to fulfill the 900 hour requirement. They want PW students to keep coming to the Commonwealth, so they want to make it as accessible as possible to join them.

**Q:** What are you looking for in an interview?  
**A:** They want 2.5 or better GPA (cumulative), that you have at least 60 credits, and, in general, they look to see if you followed the proper directions to apply, and they look for competency-based resumes; how some experience has lead to an improvement in a specific skill. For interviews, they expect you to be nervous; if you are, they know that you care and want to do well. Don't be afraid to be honest, and try your best to answer every question to the best of your ability. 

**Q:** Do you have to submit separate applications for different bureau?  
**A:** There are two application links that are live currently. There are 2 links on paauditor.gov/careers, you can apply to both, but after your application is screened, you are eligible for any bureau. 

**Q:** What are some technical skills or experiences that students need?  
**A:** From an entry-level perspective, you just need to be minimally qualified. You don't need to be any specific major, but you only need just 12 credits in any of the related fields. A basic Excel and Word knowledge is enough, as well as other Microsoft Suite applications. Written communication is very important, sometimes more important than the rest of the work.

**Q:** How difficult is it as a senior to do the Intern 2 Hire progam?  
**A:** You do have to essentially become a full-time employee to get at the 900 hour requirement, although you can do a lot of it during the summer, and that's why there are three months post-graduation to complete them. 

**Q:** In general, how many people are hired (for internships and full-time employees)?  
**A:** Internships are based on the needs of the bureau. Last year, they brought on about 18 interns across the 7 bureaus. For full-time employees, it's harder to tell, but the plan for interns is always for them to eventually become full-time employees. Luckily, they're almost always looking to gain a few full-time employees in western PA. Generally, they post 1-5 job postings per month. Most of the time, they need to replace retiring employees.

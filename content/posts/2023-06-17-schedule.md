# Discussions

## Logo

Checked in with everyone about the Logo again.

The bracket engraving on the hammer head is liked and the consensus is still that the wood grain is too detailed.

## Website

Set up another website code jam for Thursday @5:00 PM.

General consensus seems to be; keep moving forward with the React thing.

## SAI Status

Karl still needs to call SAI.

## Discord Review

Might uncheck some GitHub webhooks. The channel configurations seems good for now.

# Playdate Project
## Deciding on an Idea
Last week we came up with about 30 ideas for something we could make, and we need to decide which idea we want to flesh out more and develop. 
### Simple Ideas Pool
We had 3 options which were voted on in the discord:
- Snake clone
- Asteroids clone
- Breakout clone

Asteroids won, and we discussed its details in a shared word document (available via a link in \#club-meeting-chat). 
# Next Week
Next week's meeting will take place on Tuesday, September 24th, and we'll also be holding an additional/optional meeting over Discord this Friday around 6 P.M, where we'll be fleshing out the development roadmap. 

Next week, we'll be having a guest speaker -- a PennWest alumni from Erie Insurance. He'll be meeting us through a Zoom call, and it will be a great opportunity to make connections.

## LeetCode Problems

We went over several LeetCode problems. Not much to say about them, apart from that we wanted to find ones that weren't too hard, but also weren't too easy.

## Next Week

Next meeting will be the first of the spring semester! We'll most likely be doing a presentation about GitHub (as an introduction/refresher).

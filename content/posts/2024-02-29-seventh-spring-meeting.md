### Resumes

Purpose of a resume: 
- to get noticed by HR
- first impression
- a quick advertisement about you
- highlights relevant skills, talents, etc
- the resume __gets you the interview__

Required skills for every job:
- Communication
- Problem solving
- Teamwork, leadership
- Strong work ethic / initiative

You should be tailoring your resume. A good place to start is to put everything you've ever done on your resume, then use it like a menu and choose certain things from it to include. Use the job description (contact the organization or use a search engine if not provided) to connect your resume to the job. 

Recruiters are trained to scan through resumes very quickly and to look for certain keywords -- this is why using words from the job description is extremely important for getting noticed. 

### Sections of a resume

Example 2 (anywhere else):

### Using AI-Generative Tools
Using LLMs to improve your resumes can be very helpful and/or time-saving. You can copy and paste a resume into the chat box, and ask it to tailor it to a specific job. While it can definitely be helpful, you should always go through its work and make sure that the changes it makes represents you.

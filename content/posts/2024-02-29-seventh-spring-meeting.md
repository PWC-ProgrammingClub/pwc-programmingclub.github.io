### Resumes
Purpose of a resume: 
- to get noticed by HR
- first impression
- a quick advertisement about you
- highlights relevant skills, talents, etc
- the resume __gets you the interview__

Required skills for every job:
- Communication
- Problem solving
- Teamwork, leadership
- Strong work ethic / initiative

You should be tailoring resume. A good place to start is to put everything you've ever done on your resume, then use it like a menu and choose certain things from it to include. Use the job description (contact the organization or google if not provided) to connect your resume to the job. 

Recruiters are trained to scan through resumes very quickly and to look for certain keywords -- this is why using words from the job description is extremely important for getting noticed.
